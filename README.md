## Data

The cases data comes from the [2020 coronavirus pandemic in the Philippines page in wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_coronavirus_pandemic_in_the_Philippines) which also gets mostly of their data from the [DOH COVID-19](https://www.doh.gov.ph/2019-nCoV) page while the checkpoints data comes from [safetravel.ph](https://safetravel.ph/). It is
programmatically retrieved, re-formatted and stored in the cache for one hour.
